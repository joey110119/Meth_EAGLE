## detailed description
### Meth-EAGLE can do:
1. "variant quality scores":
    (a) As the general output of EAGLE, Meth-EAGLE can give "variant quality scores".
2. "methylation quality scores":
    (a) To remove the bias which may be generated by variants,
          Meth-EAGLE modifies the given reference sequence by the best variant set calculated by the previous procedure.
    (b) Supposing all CpG sites are the potential methylated cites,
          Meth-EAGLE uses this modified reference sequence to calculate the "methylation quality scores" of all CpG sites.
